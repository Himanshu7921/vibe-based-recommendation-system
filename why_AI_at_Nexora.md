# Why AI at Nexora?

AI at Nexora redefines fashion discovery through intelligence that understands moods, not just keywords.  
By combining generative AI, embeddings, and vibe-based search, Nexora creates a shopping experience that feels personal, intuitive, and emotionally aware.  
It leverages AI to interpret a user’s style, context, and intent, transforming simple queries into meaningful, vibe-aligned fashion recommendations.

**Note:**  
Method-3 demonstrates the **end-to-end AI Recommendation Pipeline**, showcasing full automation and contextual retrieval.
