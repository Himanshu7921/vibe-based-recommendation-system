    "* I’ll use **Hugging Face’s Sentence Transformer model** to convert both the user’s query and each product description into numerical embeddings locally (no API required).  \n",
    "* I’ll then compute **cosine similarity** using `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` to measure how semantically close each product is to the given query.  \n",
    "* The **`timeit`** library will be used to measure the time taken for embedding generation and similarity computation, helping assess efficiency.  \n",
    "* Finally, I’ll rank and display the top matching products based on their similarity scores to identify which ones best fit the user’s vibe.  \n",
